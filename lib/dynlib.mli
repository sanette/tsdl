(** Simple dynamic library loader for ctypes-based bindings *)

(** [load ?env ?debug ~name candidates] tries to load a dynamic library.

    - [name] is used for diagnostics only (e.g. "SDL2")
    - [candidates] is a list of filenames / paths to try
    - if [env] is provided and the environment variable exists,
      its value is tried first
    - if [debug] is true, detailed errors are printed

    Returns [Some handle] on success, [None] on failure.
